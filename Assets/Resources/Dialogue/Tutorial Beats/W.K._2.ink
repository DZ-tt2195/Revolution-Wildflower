When your turn ends, it goes to the guard's turn, in which all guards in the level will move. 

Guards have their own movement, that can be seen when you hover over them.

Red tiles in front of guards are their view of you, if any of your characters are caught in their view, they will be chased.

Guards can and will hurt you if given the chance. Once one character loses all of their Health Points (HP), you lose the mission and will have to restart.
