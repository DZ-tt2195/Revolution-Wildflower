If anyone’s <color=”red”>Health Points (HP)</color> reaches zero, you’ll have to abort the mission.","\n","^Fortunately, the crew has come prepared with countermeasures.","\n","^Each character has a unique hand of <b>Cards.</b> They have a variety of beneficial effects. Consider them a toolkit.","\n","^You can right-click any the card to enlarge it and see it in more detail.
